What is data filtering ? 
Data filtering is the process of selecting a small portion of a large data set based on desired criteria.

Why filter data ? 
Marketing consultant Bruce Harpham says data filtering is necessary because “the sheer volume of data we must manage today is incredible. 
Even a large business can drown in data generated by Facebook, Google, and other advertising platforms. 
Without filtering, data is nearly impossible to use effectively.”
